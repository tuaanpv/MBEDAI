I developed this source code in 2018 for learning AI/ML/ComputerVision. It almost exclusively uses C/C++ with FFMPEG, WebSocket, OpenCV, Dlib, TensorFlow, Yolo, SSDMobile,...

Video result: It can run parallel 10+ models of AI algorithms, such as Yolo, SSDMobile, Tensorflow, face detection, face recognition, traffic signs, and license plate detection.

I'll clean and update the source code soon for anyone who needs to learn AI/CV :)
